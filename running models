We want to call a shell script to run our model when we are working on DTU cluster 

We want to run our model directly from python when we are working on laptops 
 

We want a very verbose logging system, as we will run many different models, 
and thus it can easy be difficult to know when what happend

Input to shell files:
    None - All generated 

shell/train.sh  -> 
    (error file, out file), 
    (model archictectures), 
    (hyper parameter settings), 
    (epoch / different losses),
    (some training images for visualization)
shell/test.sh   -> 
    (error file, out file), 
    (model archictectures tested), 
    (hyper parameter settings used), 
    (different losses),
    (some test images for visualization)

Input to python files:
    Some ID for grouping 

train.py  -> 
    (model archictectures), 
    (hyper parameter settings), 
    (epoch / different losses),
    (some training images for visualization)
test.py   -> 
    (model archictectures tested), 
    (hyper parameter settings used), 
    (different losses),
    (some test images for visualization)
